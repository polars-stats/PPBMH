Consider our hurricane example above: the statistician equivalently predicted that the probability of the hurricane striking was between 0% to 1%.

        "In Bayesian inference, we have a mindset that the unknown parameters are really random variables with prior and posterior distributions. Concerning the posterior distribution, a value drawn from it is a *possible* realisation of what the true parameter could be. Given that realisation, we can compute a loss associated with an estimate. As we have a whole distribution of what the unknown parameter could be (the posterior), we should be more interested in computing the *expected loss* given an estimate. This expected loss is a better estimate of the true loss than comparing the given loss from only a single sample from the posterior.\n",

        "First it will be useful to explain a *Bayesian point estimate*. The systems and machinery present in the modern world are not built to accept posterior distributions as input. It is also rude to hand someone over a distribution when all they asked for was an estimate. In the course of an individual's day, when faced with uncertainty we still act by distilling our uncertainty down to a single action. Similarly, we need to distill our posterior distribution down to a single value (or vector in the multivariate case). If the value is chosen intelligently, we can avoid the flaw of frequentist methodologies that mask the uncertainty and provide a more informative result. The value chosen, if from a Bayesian posterior, is a Bayesian point estimate. \n",

Of course, one way to achieve accurate predictions is to aim for accurate predictions, but often your prediction measure and what frequentist methods are optimising for are very different. \n",

I say active as it engages in some learning, whereas predicting the sample mean is technically *simpler*, but is learning very little if anything. The loss that determines the coefficients of the regressors is a squared-error loss. On the other hand, if your prediction loss function (or score function, which is the negative loss) is not a squared-error, like AUC, ROC, precision, etc., your least-squares line will not be optimal for the prediction loss function. This can lead to prediction results that are suboptimal. \n",
