        "### TensorFlow Graph and Eager Modes\n",
        "\n",
        "TFP accomplishes most of its heavy lifting via the main `tensorflow` library. The `tensorflow` library also contains many of the familiar computational elements of NumPy and uses similar notation. While NumPy directly executes computations (e.g. when you run `a + b`), `tensorflow` in graph mode instead builds up a \"compute graph\" that tracks that you want to perform the `+` operation on the elements `a` and `b`. Only when you evaluate a `tensorflow` expression  does the computation take place--`tensorflow` is lazy evaluated. The benefit of using Tensorflow over NumPy is that the graph enables mathematical optimizations (e.g. simplifications), gradient calculations via automatic differentiation, compiling the entire graph to C to run at machine speed, and also compiling it to run on a GPU or TPU. \n",
        "\n",
        "Fundamentally, TensorFlow uses [graphs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs) for computation, wherein the graphs represent computation as dependencies among individual operations. In the programming paradigm for Tensorflow graphs, we first define the dataflow graph, and then create a TensorFlow session to run parts of the graph. A Tensorflow [`tf.Session()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Session) object runs the graph to get the variables we want to model. In the example below, we are using a global session object `sess`, which we created above in the \"Imports and Global Variables\" section. \n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid the sometimes confusing aspects of lazy evaluation, Tensorflow's eager mode does immediate evaluation of results to give an even more similar feel to working with NumPy. With Tensorflow [eager](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager) mode, you can evaluate operations immediately, without explicitly building graphs: operations return concrete values instead of constructing a computational graph to run later. If we're in eager mode, we are presented with tensors that can be converted to NumPy array equivalents immediately. Eager mode makes it easy to get started with TensorFlow and debug models.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "TFP is essentially:\n",
        "\n",
        "* a collection of tensorflow symbolic expressions for various probability distributions that are combined into one big compute graph, and\n",
        "* a collection of inference algorithms that use that graph to compute probabilities and gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "For practical purposes, what this means is that in order to build certain models we sometimes have to use core Tensorflow. This simple example for Poisson sampling is how we might work with both graph and eager modes:"

        "\n",
        "1.  We started by thinking \"what is the best random variable to describe this count data?\" A Poisson random variable is a good candidate because it can represent count data. So we model the number of sms's received as sampled from a Poisson distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Next, we think, \"Ok, assuming sms's are Poisson-distributed, what do I need for the Poisson distribution?\" Well, the Poisson distribution has a parameter $\\lambda$. \n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Do we know $\\lambda$? No. In fact, we have a suspicion that there are *two* $\\lambda$ values, one for the earlier behaviour and one for the later behaviour. We don't know when the behaviour switches though, but call the switchpoint $\\tau$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is a good distribution for the two $\\lambda$s? The exponential is good, as it assigns probabilities to positive real numbers. Well the exponential distribution has a parameter too, call it $\\alpha$.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  Do we know what the parameter $\\alpha$ might be? No. At this point, we could continue and assign a distribution to $\\alpha$, but it's better to stop once we reach a set level of ignorance: whereas we have a prior belief about $\\lambda$, (\"it probably changes over time\", \"it's likely between 10 and 30\", etc.), we don't really have any strong beliefs about $\\alpha$. So it's best to stop here. \n",
        "\n",
        "    What is a good value for $\\alpha$ then? We think that the $\\lambda$s are between 10-30, so if we set $\\alpha$ really low (which corresponds to larger probability on high values) we are not reflecting our prior well. Similar, a too-high alpha misses our prior belief as well. A good idea for $\\alpha$ as to reflect our belief is to set the value so that the mean of $\\lambda$, given $\\alpha$, is equal to our observed mean. This was shown in the last chapter.\n",
        "\n",

        "A/B testing is a statistical design for determining the difference of effectiveness between two treatments. For example, a pharmaceutical company is interested in the effectiveness of drug A vs drug B. The company will test drug A on some fraction of their trials, and drug B on the other fraction (this fraction is often 1/2, but we will relax this assumption). After performing enough trials, the in-house statisticians sift through the data to determine which drug yielded better results. \n",

        "Similarly, front-end web developers are interested in which design of their website yields more sales or some other metric of interest. They will route some fraction of visitors to site A, and the other fraction to site B, and record if the visit yielded a sale or not. The data is recorded (in real-time), and analysed afterwards. \n",

If you have taken a statistics course, you have probably been taught this technique (though not necessarily *learned* this technique). And if you were like me, you may have felt uncomfortable with their derivation -- good: the Bayesian approach to this problem is much more natural. \n"

        "On January 28, 1986, the twenty-fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle program ended in disaster when one of the rocket boosters of the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off, killing all seven crew members. The presidential commission on the accident concluded that it was caused by the failure of an O-ring in a field joint on the rocket booster, and that this failure was due to a faulty design that made the O-ring unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors including outside temperature. Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23, (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch, but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend. The data are shown below (see [1]):\n",

Yet this is clearly a poorly chosen model. On the other hand, if I did choose the logistic function for $p(t)$, but specified all my priors to be very tight around 0, likely we would have very different posterior distributions.

We only need to gather samples from the distribution of choice, and specify the number of samples, the shape of the samples (we had 21 observations in our original dataset, so we'll make the shape of each sample 21), and the probability we want to use to determine the ratio of 1 observations to 0 observations.\n",
